# Identity Authentication

This project was developed using .NET Core technology and can allow you to use this service to control or access your users.

## How it works

To use this project you just need to know how cookies work and what is the .net *Identity* class.
In this project, I demonstrate in an uncomplicated way how to create [Claims-based authorization in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/aspnet/core/security/authorization/claims?view=aspnetcore-3.0) and how to invoke their values in practice.

The presented form is a simpler way to control and authorize users to use your system when you use asp.net's Razor views framework.

## Technologies implemented

- ASP.NET Core 2.2
